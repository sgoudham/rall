# Really...? Another Logging Library?

**Yes! :P**

> rall is an incredibly simple and intuitive logger, consider this crate a _failure_ if you can't get setup within **30 seconds!**

## Feature Set

- [x] Logging Levels
- [x] Coloured Output
- [ ] Options for Datetime, Current Function, Line Number, Custom Colours, etc.
- [ ] Custom Formatting
- [ ] File support

And much more to come... soonâ„¢!

## Quick Start

```rust
use rall::{SimpleLogger, Level};

// Create Default SimpleLogger
let mut logger = SimpleLogger::default();

// Log Out To Standard Output
logger.log(Level::TRACE, "My Best Friend Hazel :D");
logger.log(Level::DEBUG, "My Best Friend Hazel :D");
logger.log(Level::INFO, "My Best Friend Hazel :D");
logger.log(Level::WARN, "My Best Friend Hazel :D");
logger.log(Level::ERROR, "My Best Friend Hazel :D");
logger.log(Level::CRITICAL, "My Best Friend Hazel :D");
```

### Author Notes

I'm still incredibly early in my Rust journey and so I wanted to get comfortable and try to pick my own brain about
exposing different API's in a Rust crate. I hope to expose an intuitive and easy to understand API design that users can
instantly get started with.
